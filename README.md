# auto-pcos-classification

## Overview
This repository contains our team's submission for the Auto-PCOS Classification Challenge, focusing on the automatic classification of Poly-cystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in ultrasound imaging. Our approach leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to differentiate between healthy and un-healthy ultrasound frames, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

### Developed Pipeline
Below is a brief overview of our developed pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation:

## Challenge Background
The Auto-PCOS Classification Challenge aims to foster the development of AI models for the automatic classification of PCOS in ultrasound imaging. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine disorder affecting millions worldwide, with a significant number undiagnosed. The challenge leverages the PCOSGen dataset, a comprehensive collection of annotated ultrasound images, to encourage the creation of accurate, interpretable, and vendor-agnostic AI solutions.

## Conclusion
Our submission represents a significant step forward in the automatic classification of PCOS in ultrasound imaging. By combining cutting-edge machine learning techniques with a deep understanding of the clinical context, we aim to contribute to the early and accurate diagnosis of PCOS, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
