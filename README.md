# Auto-PCOS Classification Challenge

## Overview
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine and metabolic disorder affecting millions of women worldwide. The Auto-PCOS classification challenge aims to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the diagnosis of PCOS through ultrasound imaging, addressing the need for modern diagnostic methods.

## Developed Pipeline
Here, we provide a brief overview of our AI-driven pipeline designed for the automatic classification of healthy and un-healthy frames in ultrasound imaging.

## Achieved Results on Validation Dataset
Our model has been rigorously tested on a validation dataset to ensure its effectiveness. Below are the evaluation metrics achieved:

| Metric     | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Accuracy   | XX%   |
| Precision  | XX%   |
| Recall     | XX%   |
| F1-Score   | XX%   |
| AUC-ROC    | XX%   |
